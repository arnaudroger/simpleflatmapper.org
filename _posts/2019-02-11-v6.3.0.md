* [#574](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/issues/574) detect factory method in enclosing class, if map to ImmutableT.ImmutableTBuilder will use the method ImmutableT.builder() as an instantiator.
* [#608](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/issues/608) sql2o allow customisation of factory to support discriminator
```java
JdbcMapperFactory jdbcMapperFactory =
    JdbcMapperFactory
            .newInstance()
            .discriminator(Device.class,
                    "type",
                    ResultSet::getString,
                    b ->
                            b.when("e", ElectricDevice.class)
                                    .when("s", SolarDevice.class));

query.setResultSetHandlerFactoryBuilder(new SfmResultSetHandlerFactoryBuilder(jdbcMapperFactory));
```
