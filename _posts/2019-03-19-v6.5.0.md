# [V6.5.0](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/milestone/195?closed=1)

* [#619](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/issues/619) Object not injected when getter is Optional<T>

Beware there was some api change in the PropertyFinder object, you would only care if you implement your own mapper. 
Hence made the executive choice not to make it a major, as I guess nobody is doing that. 

When looking in sub properties, we did not filter out parents with no injection or getters, 
leading to the property being linked to a NullSetter parent.
