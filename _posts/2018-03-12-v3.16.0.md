# [V3.16.0](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/milestone/147?closed=1)

__Warning__ some of the logic to resolve column to property have been changed

for structure like `List<Tuple2<Foo, Foo>>` with the columns `bar`, `bar` but more complex like `Tuple2<TableA, List<Tuple3<TableB, List<TableC>, List<Tuple2<TableD, List<TableE>>>>>>`

in 3.15.11 it could have map too 

```
bar -> [0].element0.bar
bar -> [1].element0.bar
```

from 3.16.0 it will always map too

```
bar -> [0].element0.bar
bar -> [0].element1.bar
```

which seems far more correct.
it is still possible to force the first mapping by renaming the column in the sql or via an alias to 

`elt0_elt0_bar`, `elt1_elt0_bar`.

* [#495](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/issues/495) column with the same name are assigned to the same object in different index instead of next object with property.
