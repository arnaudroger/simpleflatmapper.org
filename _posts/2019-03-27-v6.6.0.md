# [V6.6.0](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/milestone/197?closed=1)

* [#620](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/issues/620) add ignoreColumns on XMapperFactory
* [#622](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/issues/622) ConverterService when adapting contextual adapter does not return null if converter is null
* [#623](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/issues/623) do not break on spring boot devtools reload when asm activated
* [#618](https://github.com/arnaudroger/SimpleFlatMapper/issues/618) make it easier to provide your getter using the addGetterForType methods

Beware there was some api change in the AsmFactory and ReflectionService to better handle ClassLoader and byte code generation. 
You would only care if you implement your own mapper,  
Hence made the executive choice not to make it a major, as I guess nobody is doing that.
